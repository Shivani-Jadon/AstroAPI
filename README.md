## Directory Structure and flow of The Code
This code follows MVC pattern and hence everything is differentiated and well managed:

`/routes` - containes all the routes. <br>
`/controller` - contains functions to connect to different routes. <br>
`/models` - to store data in db we need models. <br>
`/config` - contains config files for mongoose, passport or any other configs such as middlewares. <br>
